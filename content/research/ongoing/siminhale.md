# Particle deposition on human air pathway using Turbulence Modelling

_Authors: Thivin Anandh, Lokesh M, Prof. Sashikumaar Ganesan_

This project involves modelling of the turbulent fluid flow in the human air pathway geometry using Turbulence modelling methods and then coupling them with the Lagrangian approach of tracking particles in that fluid flow to identify the deposition patterns (fractions) in within the geometry.
