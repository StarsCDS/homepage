## Computational Modelling of Human Eye [Narayana Nethralaya Research Award](http://cmg.cds.iisc.ac.in/?news=narayana-nethralaya-research-award) (open to CDS-CP students, who join in Aug 2017, Fellowship Rs. 32,000/- per month) 

This project is a collaborative work with Imaging and Biomechanics Lab, Narayana Nethralaya Bangalore. The overall scope of the collaboration is to develop a customized finite element code and 3D mesh to perform patient specific inverse finite element simulations for quantifying the non-linear hyperelastic properties of the human cornea. More DetailsCustomized meshing: The human cornea is an irregular geometry that cannot be mesh with mapped settings. At the same time, the corneal collagen distribution follows an ordered pattern, which can be described with continuous functions. Since we propose to implement fiber based hyperelastic material models, a customized 3-D mesh with brick elements generator will be developed using 3-D measurements of corneal geometry. Finite element solver: The 3-D mesh will be populated with appropriate boundary conditions and material model. To solve this model, we propose to develop a parallel finite element code. Inverse simulations: General finite element simulations are forward where material properties are known. However, we need to determine the patient material properties in this case. The experimental measurement will be obtained from air-puff applanation (Corvis-ST, OCULUS Optikgerate Gmbh, Germany). Using the measurement and tools developed under (1) and (2), an inverse routine will be set up to determine the material properties. A combination of global and iterative search methods may be used so as to optimize the time required to reach a unique solution fit to the material model parameters.
