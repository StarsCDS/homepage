## A Parallel (MPI+OpenMP) Finite Element Solver [MTech/PhD (CP)](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/admissions/research-degrees/) 

The development of robust and efficient high order algorithms and their use in HPC systems is an active area of research, which needs more investigation. The drive towards high order schemes also needs scalable time integration schemes and interesting new ideas are emerging, time accurate local time stepping, the swept rule etc. More DetailsApart from other challenges associated with the parallel implementations, parallel computations require not only efficient parallel algorithms, but also highly scalable numerical methods. For instance, the choice of finite elements in finite element discretization will influence the parallel efficiency. The sparsity structure of the matrices also depends on the type of numerical scheme and can have an influence on the parallel performance of the algorithm. The use of heterogeneous architectures like CPUs and GPUs also needs a rethink on the algorithm side to exploit the full power of the hardware. The main topics are:

*   Scalable and robust high order schemes
*   High performance numerical linear algebra
*   Efficient parallel implementations
*   Scalable time integration strategies
*   Algorithms for GPUs, heterogeneous systems
