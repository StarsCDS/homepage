## Computations of thermofluidic transport of liquid metal in reactors [MTech/PhD (CP)](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/admissions/research-degrees/) 

Modelling of thermofluidic transport of liquid metal in reactors to study the dynamics of self-cooled liquid metal fusion blanket in fusion reactors such as International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactors (LMFBR) need to be performed.
